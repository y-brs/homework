            Hello, it's me<br>
            I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
            To go over everything<br>
            They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
            But I ain't done much healing
          </p>

          <p>
            Hello, can you hear me?<br>
            I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
            When we were younger and free<br>
            I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
          </p>

          <p>
            There's such a difference between us<br>
            And a million miles
          </p>

          <p>
            Hello from the other side<br>
            I must've called a thousand times<br>
            To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
            But when I call, you never seem to be home
          </p>

          <p>
            Hello from the outside<br>
            At least I can say that I've tried<br>
            To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
            But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
          </p>

          <p>
            Hello, how are you?<br>
            It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
            I hope that you're well<br>
            Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
          </p>

          <p>It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time</p>

          <p>
            So hello from the other side (Other side)<br>
            I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)<br>
            To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
            But when I call, you never seem to be home
          </p>

          <p>
